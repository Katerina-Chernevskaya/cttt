# Cloud Technology Townhall Tallinn

This repository contains the Power Apps Canvas app with samples that I demonstrated during my session at the [CTTT-2025](https://cloudtechtallinn.com/). You can download [the solution](./NamedFormulaExplorer_1_0_0_6.zip) and easily import it into your environment to explore its features. I've also included the [list of parameters](./Parameters.xlsx) used by the app. To get started, just copy the values from the provided .xlsx file into the appropriate Dataverse table included in the solution.

Enjoy!
